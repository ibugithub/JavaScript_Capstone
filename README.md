# JavaScript_Capstone
This is the non group version of the javaScript_Group_Capstone project. After familiarizing ourselves with various recent concepts such as Webpack, Babel, Jest for testing, ES6 syntax, Async-Await, etc., I am now ready to apply the acquired skills in this group capstone project, showcasing our collective learnings from the entire week.
